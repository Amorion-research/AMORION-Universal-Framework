# Temporal Cognitive Framework

This publication establishes detailed prior art for time-based cognition and temporal computational models. The focus is on exposing implementable principles and mathematical frameworks that make future patenting of these ideas impossible.

## Principles
- Time-bound cognition: Computational processes are explicitly constrained to temporal intervals.
- Temporal domain transformation: Problems are transformed into the temporal domain for simplified solutions.
- Causal coherence: Temporal dependencies are leveraged for validation and verification.
- Optimal temporal resolution: Each problem has an optimal time granularity.
- Temporal coordination: Multi-agent systems synchronize via temporal mechanisms.

## Model
Let S(t₀, t₁) be the set of operations within [t₀, t₁]. Problem complexity is reduced by:
C_T(P) = C_O(P) × τ(P)^(-α)
where τ is temporal precision and α is an exponent.

## Implementability
- Data types, algorithms, and system architecture are described such that a skilled practitioner can implement the framework.
- Examples: Binding of elements to temporal coordinates, temporal transformers, and heuristics for solution search in the temporal domain.

## Applicability
- Optimization problems, pattern recognition, and decision systems can be realized according to these principles.

## Defensive Publication
This document is intended to establish unambiguous prior art for all concepts and algorithmic approaches described herein.
