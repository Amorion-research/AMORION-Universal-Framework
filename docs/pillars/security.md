# Temporal Security

This publication establishes prior art for temporal security mechanisms where temporal constraints are used as the primary means of protection, independent of computational power.

## Principles
- Time-bound security: Vulnerability windows are explicitly limited to defined temporal intervals.
- Time-based authentication: Identity is verified via patterns requiring exact time synchronization.
- Temporal fragmentation: Information is distributed over time to prevent reconstruction outside the correct window.
- Causal chain verification: Event chains are checked to prevent replay attacks.
- Temporal isolation: Critical operations are temporally isolated from attacks.

## Model
Security level S_frag = min(k · H, n · log₂(T/δt)), where k = minimum fragments for reconstruction.

## Implementability
- Architecture, parameters, and control mechanisms are described for implementation by a skilled practitioner.
- Examples: Key management, fragmentation strategy, and time-based authentication.

## Applicability
- Quantum-resistant authentication, secure communication channels, critical infrastructure protection.

## Defensive Publication
All content constitutes unambiguous prior art and is intended to block patents on these techniques.
