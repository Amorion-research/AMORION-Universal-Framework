# Security Pillar

## Overview

The Security Pillar of DEVUS revolutionizes how we approach security by replacing computational complexity, cryptography, and AI with mathematical impossibility proofs and physical laws.

## Core Principles

1. **Physical impossibility over computational difficulty**: Security should be based on what is physically impossible, not just computationally difficult
2. **Mathematical proof over probabilistic assurance**: Security properties should be mathematically provable, not just statistically likely
3. **Transparent security over obscurity**: Systems should remain secure even when fully transparent
4. **Law-based security over algorithm-based security**: Leverage immutable physical laws rather than human-designed algorithms

## Sweet Spots

### 1. Physical Uniqueness via Temporal Measurements (PUF-Temporality)

This sweet spot leverages microscopic variations in hardware timing behavior (oscillator drift, propagation delay, microsecond jitter) for unique device identification and authentication.

Mathematical formulation:
