# Spatiotemporal Network Architecture

## 1. Definition and Principles

The Spatiotemporal Network Architecture represents a fundamental reconceptualization of networks from purely spatial structures to four-dimensional constructs that explicitly incorporate time as a first-class dimension for routing, storage, and processing.

### Core Principles:

1. **Four-Dimensional Topology**: Networks are modeled as 4D manifolds, with time as an explicit routing dimension alongside the traditional three spatial dimensions.

2. **Temporal Fragmentation**: Information is fragmented not only across spatial nodes but across temporal coordinates, creating resilience through spatiotemporal distribution.

3. **Dynamic Density Routing**: Traffic flows adapt based on both spatial and temporal density metrics, resulting in optimal distribution across all four dimensions.

4. **Temporal Addressing**: Network addresses incorporate explicit temporal components, allowing for time-based routing decisions.

5. **Isomorphic Transformation**: Network problems can be transformed between spatial and temporal domains to reveal simpler solutions.

## 2. Mathematical Model

### 2.1 Spatiotemporal Network Formalization

A spatiotemporal network is formally defined as a directed graph G(V, E, T) where:

- V is the set of spatial nodes
- E is the set of edges connecting nodes
- T is a temporal dimension across which both V and E can vary

The network state at time t is denoted G(t) = (V(t), E(t)).

### 2.2 Spatiotemporal Routing

The optimal path P from node a to node b minimizes a spatiotemporal metric:
