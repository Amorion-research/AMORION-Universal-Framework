# Spatiotemporal Network Architecture

This document openly details network design as four-dimensional systems where time is an active dimension for addressing, routing, and fragmentation.

## Principles
- Four-dimensional topology: Networks are modeled as 4D manifolds.
- Temporal fragmentation: Data is distributed over spatiotemporal coordinates.
- Dynamic density routing: Traffic is managed based on both spatial and temporal load.
- Temporal addressing: Nodes and packets are assigned explicit time windows.
- Isomorphic transformation: Network problems are transformed between space and time.

## Model
The optimal path P minimizes M(P) = α·S(P) + β·T(P) + γ·D(P), where S = spatial distance, T = temporal distance.

## Implementability
- Addressing schemes, fragmentation, and routing algorithms are described for implementation.
- Examples: Spatiotemporal routing, fragment recomposition, density computation.

## Applicability
- Resilient data transmission, congestion management, self-organizing networks.

## Defensive Publication
This document serves as prior art and blocks patent claims on these architectures and methods.
