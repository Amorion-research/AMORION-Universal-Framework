# Information-Theoretic Reduction

This document describes transformative methods for reducing complex problems to their informational core structures. All principles and techniques are described for the explicit purpose of preventing their patenting.

## Principles
- Problem isomorphism: Diverse problem types can share the same information structure.
- Minimum information principle: A problem's irreducible information content determines its actual complexity.
- Domain transformation: Problems are mapped between domains to find the simplest form.
- Information invariance: Total information is conserved during transformations.

## Model
I(P) = min{|x| : U(x) solves P}, where |x| is description length and U is a universal model.

## Implementability
- Algorithmic and structural descriptions enable practical implementation by a skilled practitioner.
- Examples: Automated domain analysis, complexity estimation, and verified information-preserving transformation.

## Applicability
- NP-hard problems, data compression, algorithm optimization.

## Defensive Publication
This document serves as prior art according to international standards.
