# Entropic Foundations

This publication details how physical and quantum entropy is harnessed as a resource for security, randomization, and efficiency. All methods are described in such detail that patenting these approaches is rendered impossible.

## Principles
- Entropy as a resource: Physical entropy is leveraged in system architecture and algorithmics.
- Multi-source entropic merging: Multiple physical sources are combined for maximal unpredictability.
- Entropy validation: Statistical and physical tests guarantee entropy quality.
- Energy–entropy balance: Optimization between energy expenditure and entropy production.
- Entropy-driven information processing: Randomness is explicitly integrated in computational flows.

## Model
Entropy quality H(S) = -Σ p(x_i) log₂ p(x_i) - B(S), where B(S) is a bias correction.

## Implementability
- Architectures for entropic merging and validation are described for implementation by a skilled practitioner.
- Examples: Statistical tests, source management, and whitening algorithms.

## Applicability
- Quantum-resilient cryptography, energy-efficient algorithms, and distributed systems.

## Defensive Publication
This publication constitutes prior art for all techniques, methods, and architectures described herein.
